[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ProjectLimitless/Badger/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ProjectLimitless/Badger?branch=master)

A server that combines multiple continuous integration tools' statuses into a single badge with templating.

## Why use Badger

Some projects are built for different platforms using different continuous integration tools, each of them have their own build status badges that look different. This tool creates a URL to embed that generates a single status using each platform you specify.

## Sample Badge

The badge generated in the sample shows a simple build status check for the [ioRPC Project](https://github.com/ProjectLimitless/ioRPC) which uses AppVeyor Windows builds and Travis CI Linux builds.

Clicking on the badge will take you to the generated status page.
